- Anchor framework security best practices
- Common attack vectors and mitigation strategies
- Program Derived Address (PDA) security
- Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) vulnerabilities
- Token program integration security

**Key Skills Acquired:**
- Static analysis of Rust smart contracts
- Dynamic testing and fuzzing techniques
- Security-focused code review methodologies
- Vulnerability classification and reporting
- Gas optimization and compute unit analysis


## Relevant Security Knowledge

### Vulnerability Categories Specialized In:
1. **Integer Arithmetic Issues**
   - Overflow/underflow detection and prevention
   - Checked arithmetic implementations
   - Safe casting patterns

2. **Access Control Vulnerabilities**
   - Authority validation bypass
   - PDA seed manipulation
   - Signer verification flaws

3. **Economic Attacks**
   - MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) vulnerabilities
   - Flash loan attacks on DeFi protocols
   - Token supply manipulation

4. **State Management Issues**
   - Race conditions in concurrent transactions
   - State transition validation
   - Atomicity violations

### Tools & Methodologies:
- **Static Analysis:** Custom Rust analyzers, Clippy extensions
- **Dynamic Testing:** Anchor test framework, Bankrun
- **Fuzzing:** Property-based testing with QuickCheck
- **Code Review:** Systematic security-focused review processes

## Audit Methodology

### Systematic Review Process:
1. **Architecture Analysis** - Overall system design evaluation
2. **Critical Path Identification** - Focus on high-value functions
3. **Vulnerability Scanning** - Known pattern recognition
4. **Edge Case Testing** - Boundary condition validation
5. **Economic Modeling** - Game theory and incentive analysis
6. **Integration Testing** - Cross-program interaction validation

### Risk Assessment Framework:
- **Critical:** Immediate fund loss or system compromise
- **High:** Significant user impact or protocol degradation  
- **Medium:** Moderate risk requiring attention
- **Low:** Best practice improvements

## Professional Development

### Continuous Learning:
- Regular participation in Solana security community discussions
- Contribution to open-source security tools
- Research into emerging attack vectors
- Collaboration with other security researchers

### Code Quality Standards:
- Comprehensive test coverage (90%+ for critical paths)
- Defensive programming practices
- Clear documentation and comments
- Consistent error handling patterns

## GitHub Portfolio

**Primary Repository:** `https://github.com/TokenHarvester`

### Featured Projects:
1. **Solana Security Tools** - Custom analyzers and testing utilities
2. **DeFi Protocols** - Production smart contracts with security focus
3. **Educational Content** - Security-focused tutorials and examples
4. **Audit Reports** - Practice audits and security reviews

### Code Quality Metrics:
- **Languages:** Primarily Rust, TypeScript for testing
- **Frameworks:** Anchor, Native Solana programs
- **Testing:** Comprehensive test suites with edge case coverage
- **Documentation:** Detailed README files and inline documentation

## Security Philosophy

### Core Principles:
1. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security validation
2. **Fail-Safe Defaults** - Secure-by-default configurations
3. **Principle of Least Privilege** - Minimal necessary permissions
4. **Transparency** - Clear, auditable code patterns

### Approach to Smart Contract Security:
- Assume all inputs are adversarial
- Validate all state transitions
- Implement comprehensive bounds checking
- Design for graceful failure modes
- Prioritize fund safety over feature complexity
